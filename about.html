            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              It started in a small garage, with a group of friends spending weekends detailing
              cars, installing aftermarket parts, and helping each other with DIY upgrades. We
              realized how hard it was to find trustworthy accessories that actually delivered on
              their promises.
            </p>
            <p>
              CarZone was born from that frustration. Today, we partner directly with vetted
              manufacturers to bring you a focused selection of products that balance performance,
              durability, and value.

            Even though this is a demo site with a mock checkout, it reflects how we think a modern
            car accessories experience should feel: clean, straightforward, and focused on making
